    "# Project Overview: \n",
    "\n",
    "This project focuses on implementing fundamental data structures and algorithms, including trees (binary trees, binary search trees, and balanced trees) and hash tables, using Python programming language. In addition to the \n",
    "\n",
    "previously mentioned basic data structures (arrays, linked lists, stacks, and queues), the project will cover essential concepts in trees and hash tables, providing hands-on experience in designing, implementing, and analyzing their performance.\n",
    "Project Objectives:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.\tImplement basic data structures including arrays, linked lists, stacks, and queues as well as trees (binary trees, binary search trees, and balanced trees) and hash tables in Python.\n",
    "2.\tImplement fundamental algorithms such as sorting algorithms (e.g., Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort), searching algorithms (e.g., Linear Search, Binary Search), and tree traversal algorithms (e.g., in-order traversal, pre-order traversal, post-order traversal) in Python.\n",
    "3.\tAnalyze the time complexity and space complexity of implemented algorithms, focusing on their efficiency and performance characteristics.\n",
    "4.\tDevelop test cases to validate the correctness and effectiveness of implemented data structures and algorithms, covering various scenarios and edge cases.\n",
    "5.\tCompare the performance of different sorting algorithms and tree traversal algorithms in Python, evaluating their suitability for different input sizes and types.\n",
    "6.\tExplore and implement basic hash functions and collision resolution techniques in hash tables using Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Project Deliverables:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.\tPython code implementing basic data structures and algorithms including trees (binary trees, binary search trees, balanced trees) and hash tables.\n",
    "2.\tDocumentation providing detailed explanations of the implemented data structures and algorithms, including design principles, functionalities, and usage examples, in Python.\n",
    "3.\tTest cases and validation reports demonstrating the correctness and effectiveness of implemented solutions, covering various scenarios and edge cases, in Python.\n",
    "4.\tPerformance analysis report comparing the time complexity and space complexity of different algorithms in Python, evaluating their efficiency and performance characteristics.\n",
    "5.\tPresentation slides summarizing key findings, challenges faced, and lessons learned during the project, using Python.\n",

    "Project topic: \n",
    "\n",
    "A store inventory.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use lists stacks and queues for different kind of products, I.e., queues for managinig FIFO products, or stacks for products that don't mind waiting in shelves, and search algorithms to find the products themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "The class hash table has:\n",
    "\n",
    "Arrays: Used to create the table in self. table.\n",
    "linear search: Used I.e., in the add function to check if the key already exist.\n",
    "polymorphims: Used I.e., in the search function, it acts differently depending on the nature of the object it encounters.\n",
    "collision resolving method: Chaining collision method, which uses buckets that uses a list of lists for saving objects that share a key.\n",
    "linear traversal: In the show function, we use iteration to go over each linked hashtable and object.\n",
    "recursive traversal: In the simple show function.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Time complexity and space complexity:\n",
    "\n",
    "Collision resolving method, chaining: \n",
    "Uses a complexity of O(n). This method is implemented in the hash function and inherited in every other function called in the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamic Size for space complexity: \n",
    "Chaining allows the hash table to potentially exceed its initial size in terms of the number of stored elements, as the lists can grow as needed to accommodate more entries. Furthermore, it is possible to make the table bigger (when creating it) to have better performance."
