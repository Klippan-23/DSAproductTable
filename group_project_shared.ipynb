    "\n",
    "This project focuses on implementing fundamental data structures and algorithms, including trees (binary trees, binary search trees, and balanced trees) and hash tables, using Python programming language. In addition to the \n",
    "\n",
    "previously mentioned basic data structures (arrays, linked lists, stacks, and queues), the project will cover essential concepts in trees and hash tables, providing hands-on experience in designing, implementing, and analyzing their performance.\n",
    "Project Objectives:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.\tImplement basic data structures including arrays, linked lists, stacks, and queues as well as trees (binary trees, binary search trees, and balanced trees) and hash tables in Python.\n",
    "2.\tImplement fundamental algorithms such as sorting algorithms (e.g., Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort), searching algorithms (e.g., Linear Search, Binary Search), and tree traversal algorithms (e.g., in-order traversal, pre-order traversal, post-order traversal) in Python.\n",
    "3.\tAnalyze the time complexity and space complexity of implemented algorithms, focusing on their efficiency and performance characteristics.\n",
    "4.\tDevelop test cases to validate the correctness and effectiveness of implemented data structures and algorithms, covering various scenarios and edge cases.\n",
    "5.\tCompare the performance of different sorting algorithms and tree traversal algorithms in Python, evaluating their suitability for different input sizes and types.\n",
    "6.\tExplore and implement basic hash functions and collision resolution techniques in hash tables using Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Project Deliverables:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.\tPython code implementing basic data structures and algorithms including trees (binary trees, binary search trees, balanced trees) and hash tables.\n",
    "2.\tDocumentation providing detailed explanations of the implemented data structures and algorithms, including design principles, functionalities, and usage examples, in Python.\n",
    "3.\tTest cases and validation reports demonstrating the correctness and effectiveness of implemented solutions, covering various scenarios and edge cases, in Python.\n",
    "4.\tPerformance analysis report comparing the time complexity and space complexity of different algorithms in Python, evaluating their efficiency and performance characteristics.\n",
